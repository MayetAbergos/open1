<br>Chapter I
<br>Walking through the Valley
<br>“Everyone is fighting a battle we have no idea about” some stay silent, some find ways to cope, some, once healed, choose to use their lives as a living message to set others free. Today, we walk through mists of the valley, a journey of how a friend turned enemy to ending in reconciliation.
<br>
<br>Let me introduce, once again Irish; my high school buddy, partner, sister, and co-survivor. This is her story, a true story on how she stood back up after being beaten down multiple times. You may read, Efflorescence, the passing of her dear father. On the same year, she received a message from a “stranger” online. A message that brought fear, anger, distress, and pain to her.
<br>
<br>. . .
<br>
<br>“Surround yourself with people who make you feel safe” But how do we know the safe ones? It happens; even those closest to us break our hearts, hurt us, turn their backs on us, betray us, or worse, mistreat us by asking for sensitive photos online.

<br>
<br>I know what you’re feeling; enraged, disgusted, disturbed, sad, or even triggered. This was what we were feeling too. Especially, Irish.
<br>
<br>Knowing her, she is the most kind-hearted and down-to-earth person. She is giddy, fun to be with, and amazing. For someone to do this to her, even as her friend, for me was unforgivable.
<br>
<br>You may be asking for what reason? What does the stranger have that could possibly make Irish give in? Before we continue, let me share a little backstory.
<br>
<br>The person behind requested that his identity be kept anonymous and he, actually, is not a stranger at all. This person has known Irish for quite a while. Throughout this writing, we use the name “Chris”.
<br>
<br>“Chris” managed to get hold of Irish’s video taking a bath in one of their get-togethers. Not only Irish’s but also some of the girls who were part of the event.
<br>
<br>And so, he sent this…

<br>
<br>Irish may be kind-hearted and gracious but she wasn’t going to let this slip. She contacted another close friend Arlyn Purugganan. They went to a number of police stations to find a way to track this account, but there wasn’t any luck.
<br>
<br>On the same day, Irish and I met.
<br>
<br>We stayed at Sheniah Agaza’s place the whole night planning, thinking about possible suspects. I’ll pause for a bit. This is what happens, I repeat, this is what happens when someone decides to selfishly act upon impulse and use people to fill their void. It, destroys the other person’s peace.
<br>
<br>If you’re reading this and you do the same thing, I mean not to condemn, but, give some time to please think of the damage it causes you and others. Let it not result into self-hatred, addiction, social anxiety, isolation, or anything worse. Please.
<br>
<br>If you’re reading this and you have done it, I mean not to make you feel guilty, if you have chosen to end it and never do it again, I pray complete freedom for you. May you use your life to advocate on preventing and giving awareness for this type of situations.
<br>
<br>Let us all, take little steps into making the world a safer place again.

<br>Chapter II
<br>Valley of Kidron
<br>According to Pastor Bill Wilson’s book, The Teflon Rhino, the valley of Kidron represents the valley of pits and falls, where the most painful events occur. Faith does not always prevent these things from happening, but what it does do, is take us out, victoriously.

<br>
<br>Or by force…
<br>
<br>Sarah Berry, a psychosexual and relationship therapist says,
<br>
<br>“A high sex drive can be a symptom of something medical – either a condition or the medication you take. This can include the results of Parkinson’s medication, some brain injuries, mania, hormonal imbalances and an overactive thyroid.”(1)
<br>
<br>The following are also possible causes:
<br>
<br>Grief.
<br>Stress, anxiety and depression.
<br>Unresolved trauma – sexual or otherwise.
<br>Shame surrounding one’s sexual preferences, experiences or body image.
<br>A lack of fulfilment and/or control over one’s life.
<br>Distorted beliefs around love, sex and intimacy.
<br>A lack of self-esteem and/or social anxiety.
<br>An all or nothing approach to life which can make downtime or boredom hard to cope with.
<br>An inability to properly process one’s emotions.
<br>Feeling stuck in relationship with someone who wants to have less sex.
<br>However, no matter what the cause is, you are accountable for your actions.
<br>
<br>Irish decided to boldly escalate the situation in global media and was surprised to find out that she wasn’t the only victim.

<br>
<br>Observing the action, language, and aggressiveness acted upon “Chris”, he is indeed, in need of more than just help but a higher form of reprimand.
<br>
<br>The next year, things became heavier, Irish got severely damaged by the turn of events. On the flip side, “Chris” was caught. The victims took the case to court and is still under trial.
<br>
<br>What does “Chris” has to say?

<br>Chapter III
<br>Valley of Eshcol
<br>Also known as the valley of decisions, the valley where the Israelites camped before heading to the Promised Land (2). Decisions ultimately affect the course of our lives. I mean no disrespect with whatever reasons one has for their actions but, I do believe that we have a choice, may today be the day that we choose to go beyond what is self-seeking and more for being not entitled, rather accountable for others.
<br>
<br>I was given a chance to speak with “Chris” himself via an application called twitter. He relayed his story of being raped by the age of 5 years old by his own tutor. His words were,

<br>“Hindi ko alam kung may malaki bang epekto ‘yun sa pagkatao ko, pero hindi ko naman napansin. Alam ko lang nadumihan ‘yung pagkabata ko. Pakiramdam ko naman na malaking epekto yun na sa maagang edad ay na mulat ako sa ganung realidad. Hanggang sa naging normal na lang sa akin ‘yun. May isa akong napagkwentohan noon ‘yung pinaka malapit kong kaibigan, syempre mga bata unang reaksyon niya ay naastigan, dahil sa makamundong pananaw ay “astig” ‘yon. Marami rami akong nakilalang tao na halos naimpluwensyahan ako sa panonood ng bold. Siguro ‘yan ‘yung unang mga dahilhan.”

<br>
<br>“I do not know if it had a big effect on my personality, but I didn’t notice. All I know is, my childhood was stained. I feel like it I had an early onset reality about those things. Until it became a norm to me. When I was younger, I told my friend about it and his reaction was “that is cool” because in a worldly perspective, it is “cool”. I had a lot of people around me who influenced me in watching porn. I guess that became the first reason.”
<br>
<br>According to Mayo Clinic (3), compulsive sexual behavior may lead to the following complications:
<br>
<br>Struggle with feelings of guilt, shame and low self-esteem
<br>Develop other mental health conditions, such as depression, suicide, severe distress and anxiety
<br>Neglect or lie to your partner and family, harming or destroying meaningful relationships
<br>Lose your focus or engage in sexual activity or search internet pornography at work, risking your job
<br>Accumulate financial debts buying pornography and sexual services
<br>Contract HIV, hepatitis or another sexually transmitted infection or pass a sexually transmitted infection to someone else
<br>Engage in unhealthy substance use, such as using recreational drugs or drinking excessive alcohol
<br>Be arrested for sexual offenses

<br>We all have been hurt and carry the weight of the past with us, we have become victims, may it stop, today in and through you and me. You have the choice to make it happen. You have the choice to be different. You have the choice to surrender it all. We have that choice.

<br>I encourage you, no, more than that, I compel you, to choose that now.

<br>According to The Reward Foundation, “… Even three hours of porn use a week can cause a noticeable reduction in grey matter in key areas of the brain. When brain connections are involved, that means it impacts behaviour and mood. ” (4)

<br>Chapter IV
<br>Journey to the Mountaintop
<br>…those who are engaged in this kind of experience [peace] are very still on the inside and yet can function very competently in the world. (5) — Achieving Peace
<br>
<br>April of 2020,
<br>
<br>Untitled
<br>
<br>One of the bleak truths existing that we too often forget is the concept of peace. Observing the conversation, Irish proactively sought for her peace which in return gave Chris revival. Irish admits that she is now living with the scar and it may never be forgotten. But, everyday she chooses to constantly look ahead. It is never easy. Doing it ourselves is close to impossible.
<br>
<br>In these type of cases, it goes differently from person-to-person.
<br>
<br>Irish was blessed to be given a strong heart that chose to forgive. To extend her grace. It may not be the same for everyone. But I hope this inspires you too. Keeping in grudges, hatred, unforgiveness, and envy corrupts the heart. As time passes by, we fail to notice how it rots leading into varying consequences. If you’re still reading up to this point, thank you.
<br>
<br>Heal. Let the damages end with you.

<br>This photo is one the most powerful images I have seen growing up. It can mean many things, but in this context, let the power of stepping back, stepping away from our old ways help others. During this time of quarantine we are most vulnerable.
<br>
<br>May Irish and Chris serve as a light for all of us.
<br>
<br>If you are wondering how is Irish today here’s what she has been doing;

<br>She is recently leading a movement entitled “New Normal” with a purpose of reaching out high school batchmates with the desire of pointing them towards knowing the person of Jesus. She is also the head of the marketing team in her local church Christ Commission Fellowship.
<br>
<br>Other things she does for God’s glory are;

<br>
<br>(2) Makeup – She does amazing makeup on me and other people. Truly an artist!
<br>
<br>(3) Arts &amp; Writings – A blog for expressing her thoughts through words brokenandpursued.blogpost.com (7) and instagram with photography, crafts, and creations.
<br>
<br>She was indeed broken yet pursued by a God who loves us so dearly. This is also open for you, reader. Jesus Christ is ever waiting for you to come back and mend all the pieces creating something beautifully new.
