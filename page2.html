<br>Why do we do what we do?
<br>
<br>There’s so many answers to one question but all of them fall under one thing: Purpose. 
<br>
<br>Do you love art?
<br>
<br>Art is expressing as they say but have you ever thought of art as being a means of reviving life and building a community? or a medium of bond strong enough to connect hearts? or can art reach on a soul level in ways not everyone understands?
<br>
<br>If you’re reading this right now, let me share a tale of what once was just a dream, a goal, a concept, and an idea coming into life through passion, dedication, hard work, and perseverance.
<br>
<br>But, before anything let me share my journey.
<br>
<br>I am a transferee student from DLSMHSI and was blessed to be accepted into the community of UPM. Like any other change we go through a series of adjustments from study habits to self-management to making time for our loved ones to our own “me time”.
<br>
<br>Dancing — has been one of my most loved ways of coping with stress. Moving the body, grooving, following the pattern and rhythm of the music,  and letting the energy flow out, rejuvenates my mind and soul.

<br>During the process of my transition, my high school friends were ever supportive. They guided me in almost every step of the way. Blessings. Really. Sirikit De Vera, referred me into joining UP Manila Belle, one the university wide organizations comprised of females believing in artistry, femininity, and heart.
<br>

<br>
<br>I prayed about it and God approved,
<br>
<br>20200314_150651
<br>
<br>Here we go! Let’s see what God’s going to do.
<br>
<br>August 23, 5:00 PM, we dance our way to purpose.
<br>

<br>
<br>This school year was the first time that the organization ever held auditions. It has always been through invitation and they changed the system, an opportunity all I believe made possible by the executive committee and their adviser Mr. Joey Ogatis.

<br>Journeys are amazing don’t you think? You can never really tell whether you are just right at the beginning or it already started the moment someone told you about something or when you’re actually in it? But what matters is, you keep moving forward.
<br>
<br>September 2, 2019 was the first general assembly.
<br>
<br>70701612_2382306628763705_2512375140231151616_n
<br>
<br>To tell you honestly, at first I was feeling a bit uneasy because I can feel the strong femininity vibe. I wasn’t exactly a “lady” and I thought I needed to adjust so much to fit in.
<br>
<br>But, what I actually learned from this set of amazing females is, to know yourself and embrace who you ought to become— a strong woman.
<br>
<br>Another honest note, during trainings I struggled on attendance. I wasn’t at my best during practices either. Joggling academics, family, personal issues, and other commitments really took most of my time. I indeed, am grateful to everyone who is part of this organization.
<br>
<br>One of them is coach Dey, Daniel Asprec.
<br>

<br>Photo from: @dey_asprec, twitter
<br>He is one of the kindest and most caring people I have ever met. I was in awe watching his audition video for Indayog, UP-Manila’s dance varsity. After witnessing his performance and looking how much he grew truly inspired me to go more into this path.
<br>
<br>Dancing is no longer just an outlet, it is a lifestyle. He said, “To teach is to learn it twice”.
<br>
<br>Thank you, coach. You are highly-appreciated! You always make us laugh and your energy is the vibe. More than just a coach, he is a kuya and an inspiration. From being on-time in trainings to being true to who you are.
<br>
<br>Days passed, I got lost at some point, the half of the year 2019 went by so fast I hardly caught up. But, I didn’t quit. I was sustained.
<br>
<br>January 6, 2020, it was time to kick-off for the upcoming big event…
<br>
<br>Belle welcomed a superwoman…
<br>
<br>It was September 5, 2019 when I first encountered her. She was introduced as a professional dancer and a director of big companies that really scared the boots out of me. Unknowingly that she would root me deeper into who or what I wanted to be— bukas. 
<br>
<br>IMG20190905173238
<br>September 5, 2019
<br>“Maging isang taong bukas”, coach Deseree Mangulabnan.
<br>
<br>She became the missing link in the putting up the whole event. The instrument that God will use to make it happen. “Isang pangalan lang yung nasa isip ko nung inaayos namin itong event na ‘to, salamat Des.” — Sir Ogatis.
<br>
<br>A director, coach, choreographer, ate, mentor, and inspiration.
<br>
<br>There were bumps along the way but a soul driven by His Spirit sets fire like no other.
<br>
<br>Life lesson 362 “You can be passionate about something but with no discipline it won’t work.”
<br>
<br>Life lesson 394 “Kasa agad”
<br>
<br>Life lesson 623 “Build healthy relationships among the family”
<br>
<br>We survived 120 burpees, we can take on any challenge in life.
<br>
<br>Thank you, coach. You made a deep mark in our hearts. Mahal ko po kayo. Mahal po namin kayo.
<br>
<br>20200307_100145
<br>March 7, 2020
<br>Along with her came Gabrielle Velasquez, who sacrificed so much for this event as well. Behind the tech with coach Des. She managed the lights, gave so much hope in the group during trainings. Mama Rue! An astounding designer and dancer who added magic in Ugoy ng Duyan piece.
<br>
<br>Reminders that once you’ve built a relationship, you always go back.
<br>
<br>These are the people behind the success of this celebration. Are you prepared for more?

<br>CHAPTER III
<br>March, is known as the International Women’s Month. In line with this came about the concept of Bellissima: HerStory. The concert advocates what is the essence of being a woman.
<br>
<br>Once was just a dream of “the man who first believed” Mr. Joey Ogatis.
<br>
<br>Sir Ogatis, is my professor in Communication 10. He is one of the classic jokers but I testify one of the best intellectuals. In his class, practical skills and critical thinking are instilled. In training, he patiently supervises us outside his work hours, teaching us determination and perseverance.
<br>
<br>04
<br>
<br>Hearing him speak after everything filled my heart with great joy.
<br>
<br>Hearing him pray made it all the more meaningful.
<br>
<br>You see,
<br>
<br>God orchestrates the steps we take.
<br>
<br>When He places a dream in you rest assured that He will fulfill it according to His timing.
<br>
<br>No matter how long it takes. Wait on the Lord. He has never failed, not once.
<br>
<br>This concert indeed voiced out important messages.

<br>Every piece, every dance, every song, speaks truths.
<br>
<br>Performances that carry a sense of vitality.

<br>If you’re a woman and you’re reading this, I pray that you’ll be reminded.

<br>If you’re a man and you’re reading this, I pray that you’ll be reminded.
<br>
<br>God created you oh so wonderfully. 
<br>
<br>You don’t have to be someone else and you don’t have to pretend, you are accepted.

<br>YOU. ARE. ENOUGH.

<br>UP Manila Belle, these women are of substance and their heart for what they do is extraordinary.

<br>Not for publicity, not for popularity. Purely heart.
<br>
<br>In the group there came misunderstandings, but also friendships. There came tears but also laughter. There came downfalls, but also victories. That’s just how a family goes.
<br>
<br>I grew not only as a dancer, but as a person.
<br>

<br>Ending piece Bongga ka Day!
<br>I entered Belle like a lost little girl now I am slowly becoming.
<br>
<br>Bellissima: HerStory, truly made history. For 9 long years, March 7, 2020 at the GSP Auditorium Padre Faura, transpired a legacy. The first ever concert.
<br>
<br>Can you believe it? This organization started with only 7 members and now,
<br>
<br>01
<br>Bellissima: HerStory 2020
<br>“What’s the best gift you’ve ever received?” 
<br>
<br>The glory is God’s. We give it all back to You. Throughout everything, preparation  to the actual event. He showed grace. From being sold out to the sponsors to availability of supplies, resources, facilities, to strength, healing, protection, time, and more!
<br>
<br>God is so good!
<br>
<br>It only just began for Belle.
<br>
<br>
<br>Artistry. Femininity. Heart.

<br>Enkindle verb 
<br>
<br>set on fire,  inspire
<br>“their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work.”
<br>
<br>1 Corinthians 3:13
<br>
<br>PS. I know there is a pandemic happening around, but you can be sure that you are safe and this too shall pass. In the meantime, I pray that you find the courage to still hope in something you haven’t seen. To believe amidst the chaos.</p>
